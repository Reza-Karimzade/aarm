# aarm
##### This is a hand made 3 DOF robot PRR

##### In this project, we aiming to use deep reinforcement learning techniques to push objects with a robotic manipulator

## There are 5 pakage in this project
## 1. aarm_description
* Design a urdf file for robot visualization and simulation
* Visualize robot in RVIZ
